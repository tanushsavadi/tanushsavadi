## âœ¨ Fun Fact:

I love watching sports and keep up with five of them: cricket, football (and no, I refuse to call it soccerâ€”letâ€™s keep it real!), badminton, basketball, and field hockey. When Iâ€™m not deep into fantasy football, where I analyze player stats and make optimal transfers using Python scripts (kept hidden for competitive reasons, of course!), youâ€™ll find me either binge-watching a new TV series or playing one of my favorite sports. Oh, and Iâ€™m pretty competitiveâ€”but donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m not toxic. Just passionate!
